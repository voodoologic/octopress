Akamadoshi is a business that produces technological solutions for an ever growing digital world.  


from the [Final Fantasy Wiki](http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Mage)  
> Red Mage (赤魔道士 or 赤魔道師, Akamadōshi?, lit. "Red Magic Adherent") is a Job class in the Final Fantasy series, and is featured in several installments. It is among the first Job classes introduced in the series. 

The Akamadoshi is the "Jack of All Trades."  I Love programming and I am not affraid to of learning new things.  In fact, I've taught myself everything I know.
