My name is Doug Headley. As an entrepreneur I know that building a product can be difficult. 

Each product takes a mix of skills and people for it to come together. Software products are no exception. They need developers, designers, marketers, and most importantly of all, an entrepreneur.

Without the right mix of skills, the product could be low quality, never launch, or flat out fail in the marketplace. I’ve had first-hand experience with this from my own product. Luckily, I’ve learned from each one and from the products my clients have built with me.

If you’re building a software product, I’d like to talk to you.

Drawing on my rich and varied experience in business and software, I work with every client to help them launch and grow their product. Unlike other companies, I’m not just a “developer-for-hire” who only cares about the code. The business and marketing side is just as important as the software (and dare I say it… sometimes the marketing is even more important than the software).

What I can do for you is to bring all of my skills to the table to help you and your team build your product.

## My services are not for you if

* You’re not ready to collaborate with me on a frequent basis.
* You’re not fully committed to your business and its growth.
* You’re looking for a warm body to write code for you.

## On the other hand, we might be a good fit if

* You’re willing to talk to me about your business and your business model.
* You’re willing to be open to changing any and all aspects of your business.

##To reserve your spot, contact me for a confidential discussion

Hiring someone new to help your business can be stressful. You don’t know if they will deliver the business value you need.

I understand that. Which is why I require having new client consultation with every potential client. This confidential discussion about your business will let us see where we can collaborate and what areas I can help. Think of it as a getting to know you chat. It doesn’t make business sense for either of us to work together unless there is a chemistry and collaboration. You have no obligation on this call and can ask me about anything that’s affecting your business.
