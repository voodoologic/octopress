**Hello world!**
Here are some links I need to use to get this guy working.
* [octopress]( http://octopress.org/ )
* [example of how to actually write a post](http://labs.grupow.com/blog/2012/01/30/start-blogging-with-octopress)
* [Setup the blog on Heroku](http://neverstopbuilding.net/how-to-create-a-blog-with-octopress-on-heroku/)
* [Markdown Cheatsheat](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

My intention for the blog is to document these coding adventures
